    <h2>What are cookies?</h2>

    <p>
      Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which we
      download onto your computer or device when you visit our website. We can

      First and third-party cookies – whether a cookie is first-party or
      third-party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies
      are those set by a website that is being visited by the user, the website
      displayed in the URL window e.g. www.tongitspinoy.com. Third-Party cookies
      are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being
      visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a
      cookie through that website this would be a third-party cookie.
