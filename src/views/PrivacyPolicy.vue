    <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <h3>7.1 Data Retention</h3>
    <p>How long we retain your personal information depends on why we collected it and how we use it, but we will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, we retain your personal information only as long as required to perform the Services or other purpose that was the reason for the collection of the information. We will retain most of your personal information as long as you use the Services (i.e., until account deletion in accordance with your request) with the following exceptions: Contact Information that is obtained as a result of you participating in our promotional activities will be retained during such activities as expressly designated in the corresponding activities.</p>
    <p>We will retain personal information about you and connected with your account and/or the Services you use from us for as long as you have an active account with us. We will take reasonable measures to delete this personal information if you delete your account. However, you acknowledge that we will keep certain records (e.g., personal information relating to payments or customer service matters) where we need (and have rights) to, such as for legal or accounting purposes. We'll also keep information in order to exercise, defend, or establish our rights.</p>
    <p>In the event that the processing and retention period have terminated, but personal information is required to be retained continuously for other reasons including for archiving purposes as prescribed under applicable laws, the relevant personal information will be stored and maintained separately from other types of personal information. If you require us to destroy your personal information before the end of its life cycle (as set out in the retention policy above), we will destroy your personal information in accordance with local laws).</p>

    you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold such personal information; or<br>
    you believe the personal information we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.<br>
    You can also exercise your right to restrict our processing of your personal information (as described below) while we consider your request.</p>
    <p>We may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defense of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case. Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made available publicly on the Services and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too.</p>

    </p>
    <h2>10. Protection of Minors</h2>
      <p>We attach great importance to the protection of minors'personal information, and we will keep exploring new ways to protect minors'personal information.</p>

      <p>We will protect the legitimate rights and interests of minors by initiating anti-addiction system in accordance with relevant regulations on online game anti-addiction policies. We will make a judgment on whether the name information of an account belongs to a minor via the identification result of information such as name identity, based on which we decide whether the account shall be included in the anti-addiction system. In addition, we will collect information such as your login time, length of playing games, etc., and guide the minors to play games rationally through ways such as automatically intervening and limiting the game duration of the minors in our system, enabling the function of mandatorily exiting the game, etc. When the consumption is conducted by a person suspected to be a minor, we will then try to contact his or her parent or legal guardian for reminders, confirmations and deposition, so as to help the minors have a healthy access to the Internet.</p>

      <p>At the same time, in order to better protect both the physical and mental health of minors and facilitate a healthy access to the Internet for them, we may employ stricter anti-addiction measures on the basis of relevant anti-addiction policies related to online games. Further, we will keep conducting researches and testing various technologies to protect the minors. For example, in order to further improve the accuracy of name verification on identities and to try best to prevent minors from impersonating the identity of others, we may enable verifications in some games or for some users (subject to specific game strategies) under specific situations (for example, when you log into a game, or when you top up, purchase or make transactions during the game).</p>

      <p>Besides, we may also collect your game behavior data generated during the game (for example, the data such as the click pressure and radius, the relative position of the click, the acceleration direction, and the direction of gravity formed when you operate the game on the terminal device, and the voice data generated when you interact with other players through online voice in the game) to preliminarily determine whether the user is a minor (regarding the voice data, the system will only randomly use some of your online voice to judge whether it is from a child or an adult). If the preliminary determination shows you are a minor, we may enable the verification in accordance with the foregoing prescriptions.</p>

      <p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, please pay attention to whether the minor uses Game Service or provides his or her personal information after obtaining your authorization and approval. Please contact us if you have questions about the personal information of the minor under your guardian.
      </p>
    <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
